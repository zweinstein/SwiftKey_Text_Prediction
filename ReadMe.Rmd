## Project Background

This report is written as the intermediate Milestone Report for the Capstone Project of [Data Science Specialization][1] Certificate Program offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. I received no training in analysis of text data and I do not plan to become a world's expert in natural language processing :) However, a big part of the fun and challenge in data science is figuring out how to work with new data types to build data products people need. By completing this project, I am practicing my skills as a data scientist to analyze a new data type, quickly get up to speed on a new application, and develop a useful model in a reasonable amount of time.
